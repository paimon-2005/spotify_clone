# ðŸŽµ Spotify Clone

This project is a Spotify Clone built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It recreates the core design and functionality of Spotifyâ€™s music player, including a responsive layout, interactive controls, and smooth UI components. The play and pause icons were created using Font Awesome, adding a professional and modern touch. The goal of this project was to practice front-end web development skills while building a real-world inspired application.
